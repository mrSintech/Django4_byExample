"""
Django is an open-source Python web framework that encourages rapid 
development and clean, pragmatic design. It takes care of much of the 
hassle of web development and presents a relatively shallow learning curve 
for beginner programmers.

PRAGMATIC means:
writing clean code and managing the code in a manner as 
efficient as possible, to make it easily understandable, by the person that 
writes the code, and by the people that will read the code in the future.

Django follows Python’s “batteries included” philosophy, shipping with a rich 
and versatile set of modules that solve common web-development problems.

BATTERIES INCLUDED means:
to convey the idea that Python comes with everything you need.
